# AnimeRecommender
Anime recommendation engine using machine learning.  Final project for my CFG class. 


Project Brief: Spreadsheet Analysis
In this project you'll use Python to do very basic data analysis on a spreadsheet. The standard
project will use csv file that contains fake sales data. After completing the required tasks you are
free to change the csv file that you use.
Required Tasks
These are the required tasks for this project. You should aim to complete these tasks before
adding your own ideas to the project.
1. Read the data from the spreadsheet
2. Collect all of the sales from each month into a single list
3. Output the total sales across all months

Please find my basic data analysis project [here](https://github.com/emmabehr/Python-mini-projects/tree/main/Day%2017%20-%20read%20csv%20file)

For my extension project, I am building an anime recommendation engine using machine learning.
