# AnimeRecommender
Anime recommendation engine using machine learning.  Final project for my CFG class. 


Project Brief: Spreadsheet Analysis
In this project you'll use Python to do very basic data analysis on a spreadsheet. The standard
project will use csv file that contains fake sales data. After completing the required tasks you are
free to change the csv file that you use.
Required Tasks
These are the required tasks for this project. You should aim to complete these tasks before
adding your own ideas to the project.
1. Read the data from the spreadsheet
2. Collect all of the sales from each month into a single list
3. Output the total sales across all months

For my extension project, I am building an anime recommendation engine using machine learning. 
Dataset taken from: [MyAnimeList Database 2020] (https://www.kaggle.com/hernan4444/anime-recommendation-database-2020) 

The user interface is written using Tkinter and allows the user to view and filter a list of anime, read from the CSV file, anime.csv.  The user can choose a show and get recommendations for other anime they might like.  

The recommendations come from training a neural network using anime ratings from the CSV file animelist.csv, the model is trained by taking rating information from users and the shows that they have rated. This allows the model to compare similar animes based on user ratings and other shows that they have given similar ratings to.
